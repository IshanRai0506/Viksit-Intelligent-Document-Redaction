üìñ About The Project
Organizations in healthcare, finance, and government struggle with manual, slow, and error-prone redaction of sensitive data, despite legal mandates like GDPR and HIPAA. Viksit provides an intelligent, automated, and highly accurate solution to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) across various document formats, ensuring compliance and enabling safe data use.

Viksit is a self-contained web application that leverages a hybrid AI model, building a foundation of trust through verifiable privacy protection.

‚ú® Key Features
Hybrid AI Model: Combines OCR (for text), NER (for PII/PHI), and Object Detection (for signatures/barcodes) for superior accuracy.

Multiple Format Support: Processes PDF, PNG, and JPG documents, including scanned files with handwritten notes.

Side-by-Side View: An intuitive UI allows for easy comparison between the original and redacted document.

Audit Trail: Generates a detailed JSON log of all redactions for compliance and traceability.

Self-Contained & Deployable: Packaged as a single Flask application, easily containerized with Docker for simple deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Backend: Python, Flask, Gunicorn

AI/ML: spaCy, Pytesseract (Tesseract-OCR), pdf2image, Pillow

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served via Flask)

Containerization: Docker

Once the application is running, you can test its core functionality:

Upload a Document: Drag and drop a file (PDF, PNG, JPG) onto the upload area or use the "Choose File" button.

Process: Click the "Process Document" button to start the AI analysis.

Review Results:

Side-by-Side View: Compare the original document with the redacted version.

Redaction Summary: See a statistical breakdown of the sensitive data found.

Audit Log: View a detailed list of every redacted item for compliance purposes.

Download: Save the secure, redacted document and the JSON audit log to your local machine.

üê≥ Deployment
This application is designed for easy deployment using Docker. A Dockerfile is included, which handles all system dependencies (Tesseract, Poppler) and sets up a production-ready environment with Gunicorn. You can deploy this application to any cloud service that supports Docker containers, such as Render, Heroku, or AWS.
